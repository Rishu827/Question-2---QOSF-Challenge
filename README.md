# Question-2---QOSF-Challenge

This repository presents the in-depth solution to question 2 of QOSF Mentorship Challenge. It covers both the solution - basic part and bonus part.

Firstly go through the pdf file to get a detailed explanation about the working of code, circuits and strategy used. Then you can access the codes. I have placed the various outcome in image format in Outcome folder.

The onus question asks only to detect the error. But the solutino discussed here opens the gate to more in-depth discussion and need for quatum error correcting codes, stabilisers and other necessary things. The solution presented here provides the basic circuit design and not the stabiliser formalism theory.
